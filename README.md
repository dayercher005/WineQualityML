This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down at first request. I am not the owner of this dataset.
